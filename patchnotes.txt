V1.1.3 
• Fixed issue where battery info was not being updated after the initial boot.
• Changed from using for loops to get CPU / Mem usage to using Regex and or grep directly
• Changed how to get sleep state of device and now only use Grep instead of a for loop
• If MEMAVAILABLE is not found then we will use MemFree instead, this may result in inaccurate memory calculation.
• replaced most of print statements with g_log
• removed all the if statements for device_commands and made the values in the dropdown match the dictionary key
• Simplified getting battery states
• made source code available for any improvements
